# Neuronal polarization
Developing neurons extend multiple neurites, one of which is extremely longer than the others. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is called neuronal polarization. During the process of neuronal polarization, there is definitely a mechanical elongation of neurite elongation and the resulting changes in stress and molecular diffusion. This software models these processes and quantitatively simulates the extension of only one neurite of a neuron. For more details on the model, see the following paper:
